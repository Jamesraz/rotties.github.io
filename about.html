                <p class="gray">We’re a family run business that wants to help you find the puppy you’ve always wanted. Taking pride in what we do, we are determined to share our love for pets through a business. It is our goal to be of service to those individuals who have a passion for puppies, just like we do.

                 We have a wide variety of puppies for sale . Please browse our full list on the left side of our site to find the perfect dog /puppy for your family.
                    
                 The puppies for sale have names. We have given them such because we wouldn’t feel right if we didn’t. To make them special, it was our initiative to call them something that’s solely their own. It’s less confusing this way, too..

               <h1 class="page-t1">HOW WE DO IT</h1>
               <p class="green">Our children teach the puppies social, interactive and basic obedience skills and they also start the toilet training journey. This makes for a smooth transition for the new owners. Our kids are always a little sad to see a pup they took care of go to their forever homes, but they are also very well aware of the joy and happiness their little furry friends will bring other families, and knowing they played a part in it makes it all worth it for them. While our puppies are amazing at companionship, they also excel in service, obedience, therapy, herding, outdoor recreation, and much more! If you are looking for a puppy that is easy to train, and sometimes too smart for its own good, you’ve come to the right place! We value friendliness, respect, and timely response to every inquiry.
                We take pride in the service we provide. Because of this, our puppies will join your family with current and age-appropriate vaccinations, deworming and a full health veterinary check before coming to their forever home. Our puppies have been requested all over the world due to their quality. Feel free to contact us! will have the love, care, and training as our very own. At three days old, their dew claws are removed.
                
                They are wormed regularly (every two weeks) At 6 weeks of age their life changes dramatically. They have their first set of puppy shots, receive their microchip, and begin Puppy Academy. At 7 weeks old, they are taken to the vet for their final health examination. Our puppies also have a standard 1 yr genetic health guarantee. We believe that highly in the product.
                
                This is a socialization program which begins at birth and continues through 12 weeks of age. Our pups are introduced to Early Neurological Stimulation (starting at three days old), startle/recovery exercises, canine audio therapy, umbrellas, baby toys, crinkle toys, uneven surfaces, ramps, empty boxes, other dogs and children. They have their nails trimmed weekly, receive regular baths, get one-on-one work, have their ears played with, have their feet played with, are laid on their backs for tummy massage, spend individual time in the crate, are clicker trained, introduced to wearing a collar and will have learned to solve challenging situations.
                
                We are amazed at how well our puppies respond to the Puppy Culture program. Although it is an incredible amount of work, it is so rewarding to see our babies grow and progress with such confidence!</p>
